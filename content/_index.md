## Biography

I go by "Qiang"; my Chinese name is 汪寿强.

I am an assistant professor of Operations Management at Naveen Jindal School of Management, the University of Texas at Dallas. I earned my PhD from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, and also hold MS in Statistics (also from Duke), BS in Mathematics and BA in Economics (both from Peking University).

My research focuses on strategic operations problems that arise from both business settings as well as public domains. An overarching theme of my research is to identify managerial and operational solutions to improve efficiency and mitigate misalignment of incentives in the presence of asymmetric information and dynamic interactions among decentralized stakeholders in these contexts. My research not only seeks to make practical impacts by addressing urgent and timely business and public policy issues, I also contribute methodologically to theories of microeconomics and operations research. My research has been published at premier business research journals such as Management Science, Operations Research, and M&SOM and has received multiple best paper awards from INFORMS and POMS societies. 

I have successfully developed and delivered a variety of courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels, including Spreadsheet Modeling and Analytics, Statistics and Data Analysis,  Decision Models, Operations Management, Sourcing and Supplier Management, Logistics Management. I am a finalist for Jindal Faculty of the Year (Graduate). I also serve on multiple doctoral dissertation committees. My PhD students' research has been recognized by the prestigious Jeff McGill Student Paper Award by INFORMS Revenue Management & Pricing Section.  

I am currently an Associate Editor of M&SOM and regularly serve as judges for paper competitions, review panels of research grant proposals, referees of leading academic journals, professional conference organizers, and session chairs. I am the recipient of Management Science and M&SOM Meritorious Service Awards. I also have extensive experience interacting with business leaders such as C.H. Robinson, Orora, ScanSource, Textron Aviation, and Target.
