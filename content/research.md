    - Burning crop residue in harvested fields to prepare land for sowing a new crop is well-recognized as a significant contributor to CO2 and black-carbon emissions. A specific agricultural machine called Happy Seeder has emerged as the most effective and profitable alternative to open burning.We study how the government can use effective information-disclosure policies in the operation of Happy Seeders to minimize agricultural open burning.

    - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of properly informing the population about the epidemic when implementing governmental confinement measures. Indeed, the efficacy of these restrictions relies heavily on public compliance. Our work sheds light on how governments should inform the population to induce such social distancing behavior. Using an information design framework, our model explicitly account for the health-economy tradeoffs, the strategic externalities of individual compliance behaviors, and the economic inequality of the population.

    - Using a dynamic Bayesian persuasion framework, we formulate and study how a platform should optimally design its dynamic information provision strategy to maximize its expected revenue for a time-locked sales campaign. We make three contributions. First, we establish an equivalent reformulation of the platform’s information design problem as an LP by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the platform’s message space and proprietary history. Second, we develop an easy-to-implement, simple-to-prescribe, and near-optimal policy, which we characterize analytically. Finally, we demonstrate the value of information design against some benchmark policies commonly used in practice and offer prescriptive managerial insights.
    
* [A Stationary Infinite-Horizon Supply Contract under Asymmetric Inventory Information](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493939), with [Alain Bensoussan](https://jindal.utdallas.edu/faculty/alain-bensoussan) and [Suresh Sethi](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~sethi/). (Major revision at *Operations Research*)

    - We consider a decentralized supply chain where a supplier sells goods to a retailer facing a general random demand over an infinite horizon. The retailer satisfies the demand to the extent of the inventory on hand. The retailer has private information about his inventory in each period, and the supplier offers him a dynamic supply contract menu to account for such information asymmetry. The supplier's contract design problem can be formulated as a functional optimization with the retailer's incentive compatibility constraint expressed as a functional Bellman equation. Mathematically, the problem belongs to calculus of variations, and requires us to develop powerful new methodologies by replacing the usual concept of gradient with that of Gateaux derivative.

    - We examine the informational role of buyback contracts in credibly signaling either a manufacturer's reliability of honoring the buyback commitment, or her product's market potential. We find that these two situations form contrasting buyback designs: a manufacturer must distort the wholesale and returns prices downward to signal higher reliability and upward to signal higher market potential. The returns price emerges as a more efficient signaling instrument and reverses the direction of wholesale price distortion from what is necessary if the wholesale price alone is used to distort the returns cost.

    - We study a novel information design problem addressing the issue of sending warning messages against recurring risks, a challenge particularly prevalent in global health and disaster management arena. Our framework accounts for dynamic learning effects and which we solve in closed-form. We uncover nuanced effects that induce a warning sender to strategically exaggerate or downplay a risk when alerting an uninformed stakeholder against an upcoming threat.

    - We study an easy-to-implement class of cost-sharing mechanisms as the solution to a prevalent procurement problem, whereby the buyer faces two-dimensional private information: cost and non-cost attributes. We show how the cost-sharing fraction strikes the fundamental tradeoff between allocative inefficiency versus information rent. We characterize the optimal cost-sharing fraction in closed form and offer prescriptive guidelines on the choice of this fraction purely based on the second-moment information of the buyer’s belief distribution. We demonstrate, both theoretically and numerically, that the best cost-sharing mechanism is near-optimal.

    - Motivated by emerging business practice, such as Taylor Guitars, our study informs firms when and how to leverage a co-product's environmental value through product positioning decisions (i.e., quality and price). We find that, for intermediate material cost and lower green consumer's environmental valuation, the firm should position the co-product without extracting its environmental value from green consumers. Otherwise, the firm should position the co-product to extract all consumer surplus by charging an additional price premium.  In the latter case, the firm may strategically abandon some traditional consumers, who are, in fact, willing to purchase the more expensive traditional product, and leave their demand unfulfilled. Our research also yields important environmental and policy implications regarding conservation of scarce resources.
    
* [Signaling Product Quality through a Trial Period](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1675), with [Gülru Özkan-Seely](https://www.uwb.edu/business/faculty/gozkan-seely/profile), *Operations Research*, 66(2): 301-312, 2018.

    -A product trial period offers a learning channel, through which consumers can privately update their heterogeneous assessment of the product. This enables the trial length as a novel signal of the seller’s unobservable product quality in addition to the conventional price signal. This paper formalizes this idea in a continuous-time Bayesian learning model.

    - [Note: Entrant’s Product Quality Signaling through a Trial Period in a Competitive Market](/papers/TrialPeriod_Competition.pdf)

    - This note provides a self-contained analysis of an entrant-incumbent competition as an extension of the monopolistic trial period signaling model examined by the paper above. 

* [Resource Allocation under Demand Uncertainty and Private Information](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2574), with [Alexandre Belloni(https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~abn5/belloni-index.html) and [Giuseppe Lopomo](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/giuseppe-lopomo), *Management Science*, 63(12): 4219-4235, 2017.

    - Our findings call attention to the strategic benefits that may arise in the presence of multilateral private information from consolidating the bargaining power to the sector that is directly exposed to demand uncertainty. A novel type of distortion, which we term as "overshooting," emerges. These results resonate with the significantly different performances of the US agricultural produce and flu vaccine markets.

    - Using the framework of dynamic mechanism design with state verification in continuous time, this paper studies how to design an efficient voluntary disclosure program (e.g., US EPA's Audit Policy) that combines the two regulatory instruments: inspection and fiscal reward. We obtain a  complete analytical characterization of the optimal regulation policy.

    - This paper considers how to allocate a single object of different quality dimensions to multiple buyers who have privately known valuation for each quality dimension. We find an efficient algorithm to solve the problem numerically and identify “exclusive buyer mechanism” as a near-optimal implementation of the optimal mechanism.
