      <description>Papers   Information Design of a Delegated Search, with Yangge Xiao and Zhenyu Hu. (Under review at Management Science)
 We formulate the dynamic information design of a delegated search and fully characterize its optimal information policy, which is completely prescribed by a sequence of deterministic acceptance standards. The agent is recommended to continue the search if the current termination payoff fails to meet that periodâ€™s standard. For searches like talent recruitment, where outcomes are not recallable, acceptance standards should be gradually loosened as the search progresses so as to back-load the search incentives.</description>
